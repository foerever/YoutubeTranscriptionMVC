# YoutubeTranscriptionMVC
A coding assignment to transcribe youtube videos using the MVC design pattern.

## Introduction
Remember that one of the topics we discussed this week was the MVC (model view controller) design pattern. This is a relatively simple but extremely powerful design pattern used broadly through industry.

You can read more about the MVC pattern [here](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/DevPedia-CocoaCore/MVC.html) to refresh your memory. I was surprised to see a number of other reputable websites discussing MVC pretty badly, Apple does a good job of explaining it here correctly. In any case, I would be wary of what you read on the internet regarding MVC design pattern, it seems some people on the internet do not really understand what MVC is on a foundational level.

MVC is born out of a philosophy of purity, of building a system that is inherently flexible, maintanable, defensive, modular, coordinated, among other things. This is a rapidly growing idea in the field of Computer Science and software, we touched very briefly on functional programming once and it's a great example of this philosophy. Functional programming is a programming paradigm centered on that idea of purity, it's a programming style that in simple terms leads to less bugs and is theoretically very clean.

In any case let's get to the project at hand. You'll be fleshing out a program that transcribes youtube videos and build this program using the MVC design pattern.
